- **read contention**: occurs when multiple clients or processes are trying to read data from the same location in the database at the same time, which can lead to delays or errors
- **write contention**: occurs when multiple clients or processes are trying to write data to the same location in the database at the same time, which can lead to delays or errors
- **thundering herd**: occurs when a large number of clients or processes try to access the same resource simultaneously, which can lead to resource exhaustion and reduced performance
- **cascade**: occurs when a failure in one part of the database system causes a chain reaction that leads to failures in other parts of the system
- **deadlock**: occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release a lock on a resource, leading to a standstill
- **corruption**: occurs when data in the database becomes corrupted, which can lead to errors or unexpected results when reading or writing to the database
- **hardware failure**: occurs when hardware components, such as disk drives or memory fail, which can lead to data loss or corruption
- **software failure**: occurs when software components, such as DBMS or application fail, which can lead to errors or unexpected results
- **network failure**: occurs when the network connection between the database and the client is lost, which can lead to errors or timeouts when trying to access the database
- **denial of service (DoS) attack**: occurs when a malicious actor attempts to overwhelm the database with requests, leading to resource exhaustion and reduced performance
